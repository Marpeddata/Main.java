/*
Data - variable for servings, Course name call, ingredients(?)
Constructor - Defining servings variables(1 and 2).
Method - One for generating the list of 7 courses, one for genereting the shopping list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Initial thoughts! - -- We place a for loop here to
generate a full week of meals

We'll use a for loop to fill an array with courses based on the servings alone

possibly(?) a loop within a loop to fill out 7 slots with meals based on the servings
making sure the specific meal is back to back and not first course on monday and 2nd the following sunday

We'll use an arrayList for the courses, the course class will take a name the total of servings(1 or 2)
